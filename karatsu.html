    <div class="intro">
        <p>In March, I first rode the seaside train southwest from my home in Fukuoka Prefecture to its last stop, the city of Karatsu. During the Edo Period, between 1603 and 1868, Karatsu was a powerful coal mining town overlooked by its fortress, the Karatsu Castle. Four hundred years later, Karatsu’s defensive stone walls continue to tower over the local attractions, including the historic Takatori Residence, once the home of a 
            coal tycoon.</p>
        <p>Beyond defensive walls and a boom-and-bust coal economy, Karatsu is home to one of Japan’s oldest pottery styles. From the train station, I ventured along the town’s self-guided pottery tour, where centuries-old kilns and masters, such as the Nakazato family, present their earthen Karatsu ware to admirers.</p>
        <p>For most of my time in Karatsu, an apprehensive orange cat monitored my movement, aware that I was a newcomer in its space. We traversed the stone walkway together until it led us out toward the sea — a protective design from a bygone era. From the beach, I found shade in Japan’s largest pine forest and made my way back to town, seeking refreshments and company.</p>
        <p>While we were enjoying matcha at Calali cafe, Ms. Tokunaga shared sentiments of Karatsu’s empty streets and the greater effects of Japan’s depopulation crisis, namely a decline in community pride. “People say we don’t have a lot in Karatsu,” she said, reflecting how her family relocated to the quiet town after living in Tokyo. “For us, we think there is beautiful nature. It’s close to the mountains, the ocean. It’s culturally rich.”</p>
