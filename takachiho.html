        <p>To reach the inland town of Takachiho, I took a 45-minute flight from Fukuoka to the coastal city of Miyazaki, where I enjoyed a taste of the prefecture’s local ingredients at 6 Raccoon, an inventive cafe. From there, I caught a train to Nobeoka, followed by a bus into the mountains.</p>
        <p>In Takachiho, some 11,000 residents coexist with the forest that surrounds them. Tomonori Tasaki, a town representative, shared that although Takachiho became a tourist destination only about 40 years ago, the Japanese have long recognized it as a setting for Japan’s creation stories and mythology.</p>
        <p>The most famous attraction is Takachiho Gorge — a deep chasm carved out by several explosions from the nearby Mount Aso, Japan’s largest active volcano. On the opposite side of town is Amanoiwato Shrine, where legend holds that the sun goddess Amaterasu hid in a cave, shrouding the world in darkness. In the evening, I headed to Takachiho Shrine to view the 800-year-old Kagura performance. Here, local performers re-enact Amaterasu being lured out of her cave and pray for a successful harvest season. Takachiho’s population has declined by about 200 people annually for the past 40 years, and finding participants to continue Kagura performances proves challenging. Mr. Tasaki, who grew up in Takachiho and returned after completing university, felt hopeful about his community’s future. “If we realize the value of Takachiho,” he explained, “maybe more people will stay.”</p>
