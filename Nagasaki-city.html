        <p>In Nagasaki, a pink cable car takes you from the bullet train station to Japan’s largest Chinatown district. I visited during the Lunar New Year Lantern Festival, when hundreds of paper lanterns give the city a festive, red glow.</p>
        <p>Nagasaki plays a pivotal role in Kyushu’s nickname as Japan’s “Gateway to Asia.” The city was Japan’s only trading port open to the world during the country’s 200-year period of isolation. An influx of foreign culture and perspectives, mostly from Japan’s close neighbor China, contributed to the development of the area, which was rebuilt after the United States detonated a nuclear bomb over the northern part of the city on Aug. 9, 1945.</p>
        <p>For travelers looking to experience Nagasaki’s history through its food and drink scene, Hountei Torifuku serves cold beer and piping hot gyoza. On the other side of town, Nagasaki University students pointed me toward the Mandarin restaurant Horaiken. Here, pieces of pork, seafood and assorted vegetables are tucked inside ramen noodles and a thick bone broth to form Nagasaki’s regional dish, champon.</p>
        <p>Amid New Year celebrations, the streets were filled with vendors and tourists. Still, just beyond Chinatown was the inescapable hush of a city experiencing one of Japan’s highest rates of depopulation. After indulging in celebratory treats and needing exercise, I climbed a staircase leading through a residential hillside. A small coffee shop, aptly named Coffee House on a Hill, and minuscule gardens filled the spaces between quiet homes. I arrived at the observatory deck of Mount Nabekanmuri. The ocean glistened as ships entered the port, and thousands of homes dotted the rolling hills.</p>
