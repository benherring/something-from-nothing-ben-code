        <p>From Fukuoka, you can reach the city of Itoshima in less than an hour by train. The population of roughly 100,000 is spread across the western peninsula’s spacious beaches, mountains and rice paddies. Here, Kyushu’s humble ingredients shine.</p>
        <p>Several cafes and shops sit near the central station, Chikuzen Maebaru. Sazanami Coffee greets those seeking ceremonial matcha or homemade ginger lattes, and Oshinochitama Soba Restaurant shares dishes reliant on locally harvested salt. Even wood-fired pizza, a popular food trend in Tokyo, is served by Itoshima’s Osteria & Pizzeria Felice. In the wintertime, Itoshima’s oceanside oyster huts with smoky barbecue pits greet residents seeking warmth. Just don’t forget to don the provided rainproof gear before your oyster bursts, spraying ocean water across the grill.</p>
        <p>Born in Itoshima, Aya Takamatsu, who runs a backyard coffee shop called Gallery Yasu, spoke about the recent decrease in farmers and fishermen, and how young people continue to leave for larger cities. Her hopes for the future resonate with Kyushu’s way of life. “We want to continue as we are,” she said, “where everyone can live peacefully and happily, even in the countryside.”On the walls of Ms. Takamatsu’s shop, her father’s paper cutouts depict scenes of daily life. In one of them, a fisherman patiently sits above the neighborhood river.</p>
